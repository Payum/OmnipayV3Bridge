[Omnipay](https://github.com/adrianmacneil/omnipay) created by [Adrian Macneil](http://adrianmacneil.com/). The lib provides unified api for 25+ gateway gateways. Plus, it simple, has unified, consistent API and fully covered with tests.
This bridge allows you to use omnipay gateways but in payum like way.

## Why should you use this bridge?

Here's an [example from omnipay's repository](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay#tldr):

```php
<?php
use Omnipay\Omnipay;

$gateway = Omnipay::create('Stripe');
$gateway->setApiKey('abc123');

$formData = ['number' => '4242424242424242', 'expiryMonth' => '6', 'expiryYear' => '2016', 'cvv' => '123'];
$response = $gateway->purchase(['amount' => '10.00', 'currency' => 'USD', 'card' => $formData])->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // payment was successful: update database
    print_r($response);
} elseif ($response->isRedirect()) {
    // redirect to offsite payment gateway
    $response->redirect();
} else {
    // payment failed: display message to customer
    echo $response->getMessage();
}
```

and this is same code but done with the bridge:

```php
<?php
use Payum\Core\PayumBuilder;
use Payum\Core\Request\Capture;
use Payum\Core\Request\GetHumanStatus;
use Payum\Core\Model\ArrayObject;

$payum = (new PayumBuilder())
    ->addDefaultStorages()
    ->addGateway('stripe', ['factory' => 'omnipay_stripe', 'apiKey' => 'abc123'])
    ->getPayum()
;

$card = ['number' => '4242424242424242', 'expiryMonth' => '6', 'expiryYear' => '2016', 'cvv' => '123'];
$payment = new ArrayObject(['amount' => '10.00', 'currency' => 'USD', 'card' => $card]);

if ($reply = $payum->getGateway('stripe')->execute(new Capture($payment), true)) {
    // convert reply to http response
}

$payum->getGateway('stripe')->execute($status = new GetHumanStatus($payment));
if ($status->isCaptured()) {
    // success
}
```

Well more or less same amount of code but with the bridge you get more out of the box:

* Return\Cancel urls are generated just of the box. The urls are unique and do not expose any sensitive information.
* If you do not pass credit card, Payum asks a user for it, showing the page with the form.
* You can use Payum's packages for Symfony,Laravel,Silex,Zend,Yii with the bridge.
* Storages. Your payment is already stored on the filesystem. We advice not to use this storage in prod.
* The payment model contains all the information we were able to get from omnipay. Just use it.
* Payum abstracts workflow. It knows when Omnipay's `purchase` or `purchaseComplete` methods should be used.
* Credit card details are protected from accidental storing on your side.
* Using the builder you can overwrite any part you want, or add a Payum extension.
